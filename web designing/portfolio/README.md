Portfolio scaffold

Files created:
- index.html — main page (Bootstrap + Font Awesome)
- styles.css — custom styles
- script.js — small JS helpers

How to use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally.
2. Replace "Your Name" and copy in your CV link or image.
3. Replace project cards with your real project screenshots and links.
4. To enable real contact emails, create a Formspree form and replace the `action` on the contact form with the provided URL.

Deploy to Netlify (quick):
- Push this folder to a GitHub repo, then connect that repo to Netlify and set the deploy folder to `portfolio/` or drag the `portfolio` folder to Netlify deploy.

If you want, I can:
- Fill in your name, bio, and real projects from the files in your workspace.
- Add icons to skill cards using Font Awesome.
- Configure a Netlify deploy file (netlify.toml) and example CI.
